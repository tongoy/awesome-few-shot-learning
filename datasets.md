## Cross-domain Few-shot Learning

### PlantVillage
The PlantVillage dataset consists of 54,306 images of plant leaves from 14 crop species with a spread of 38 classes (including 26 diseases and 12 healthy).
The dataset provides three different versions of the images, i.e., colored images, gray-scaled images and segmented images.
All images in the colored version, **i.e., 54,305 images of 38 classes**, are used for cross-domain few-shot learning.

### EuroSAT
The EuroSAT dataset is based on Sentinel-2 satellite images covering 13 spectral bands and consisting out of 10 classes with in total 27,000 labeled and geo-referenced images.
The Sentinel-2 satellite images are openly and freely accessible provided in the Earth observation program Copernicus.
All colored images, **i.e., 27,000 images of 10 classes**, are used for cross-domain few-shot learning.

### ISIC-2018
The HAM10000 (“Human Against Machine with 10000 training images”) dataset consists of 10,015 dermatoscopic images which are released as a training set for academic machine learning purposes and are publicly available through the ISIC (International Skin Imaging Collaboration) archive.
All 10015 dermatoscopic images, **i.e., 10,015 images of 7 classes**, are used for cross-domain few-shot learning.

### ChestX-ray8
The ChestX-ray8 dataset is a chest X-ray database which comprises 108,948 frontal-view X-ray images of 32,717 unique patients with the text-mined eight disease image labels (where each image can have multi-labels), from the associated radiological reports using natural language processing.
Seven of the eight classes, **i.e., 25,848 images of 7 classes**, are used for cross-domain few-shot learning and each image has only one label.
Note that nowadays the ChestX-ray dataset comprises 112,120 frontal-view X-ray images of 30,805 unique patients with the text-mined fourteen disease image labels (where each image can have multi-labels), mined from the associated radiological reports using natural language processing.
